#Reverse Engineering Training


##Part1

A set of 6 challenges to teach reverse engineering  

You can use a text file to keep track of your answers so far by running the program as follows: `Part1.exe answers.txt`.  
Where answers.txt contains the answers from previous challenges, each on a new line with a newline at the end of the file.  

##Part2

A set of challenges to teach more advanced reverse engineering  

Unlike part 1 you cannot use a text file to keep track of your answers since some of the answers will not be entered as text.
